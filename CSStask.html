   <!-- <h3 class="heading"> Second section</h3> --> 
    <p class=" second-sec"> So far, I've learnt about <i>HTML, CSS, and Git</i>. About CSS, we've covered subjects, such as cascading heirachy, and CSS properties like <b>backgound color, text decoration, magin, border, and padding.</b>
      <br> CSS is a very essential part of web development, because it improves the user's experiences and makes the website easy to navigate. CSS controls how the site looks, including font, color, background, and font size.

        Explaining the <i> differences</i> between <b>paddings, margins, and borders. </b>
    </p> <br>    
       <p class="third-sec"> <b>Paddings </b> refer to the space betwwen the content and its border, while <b> borders</b>provide frames for your elements. In CSS, the  border properties allow you to define the style, width, and color of an element.
        On the other hand, CSS <b> margin </b> defines the space around an HTML element.
