     <p>My career so far has been quite interesting. After getting a degree in medical physiology, I took up a role in SEO writing for an Asian brand. I love writing, so I thought: why not earn money doing that? Along the line, I decided I wanted something more challenging, which brought me into pursuing a career in Tech. I first dived into UX/UI design - did that for some time, before finaly switching to software development </p>
